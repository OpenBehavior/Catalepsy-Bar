# Catalepsy-Bar

A low-cost automated apparatus for measuring catalepsy that increases measurement accuracy and reduces observer bias.

Designed by Karling Luciani (PI: jkhokhar@uoguelph.ca)

The automated catalepsy bar test is an open-source, 3D-printed test apparatus used to make catalepsy measurements in rats more standardized and accurate. This system is easy and relatively inexpensive to set up. The outer box is the only printable part of this project, and the authors provide links to the electronics required to complete the system.
